Gabriel Schulhof,gabrielschulhof@gmail.com,2023-07-08T21:58:22Z,"test: run interfering tests in their own process

Tests such as addon and addon_data both use SetInstanceData. Thus, they
overwrite each other's instance data. We change them both to run in a
child process such that they do not call SetInstanceData on init, but
rather they return a JS function on init which, when called, produces
the actual binding which needs SetInstanceData.

We also introduce a utility function for launching a test in its own
child process for the purpose of running tests that would otherwise
interfere with each other.

When we wrap a primitive value into an object in order to throw it as
an error, we call `napi_define_properties()` which may return
`napi_pending_exception` if the environment is shutting down. Handle
this case when `NODE_API_SWALLOW_UNTHROWABLE_EXCEPTIONS` is given by
checking whether we're in an environment shutdown scenario and ignore
the failure of `napi_define_properties()`, since the error will not
reach JS anyway.

Fix this by deleting the tsd variable if `_tsfn.NonBlockingCall()`
doesn't return a `napi_ok`.

These adjustments make it a bit more complete now by providing all three necessary parts, the worker, the hookup code, and the javascript usage of it.

I have also gone ahead and rewritten the `AsyncProgressQueueWorker` example to show demonstration of the `FunctionReference` class and how to use multiple callbacks instead of one combined callback.","[{""filename"": ""doc/async_worker_variants.md"", ""additions"": 141, ""deletions"": 40}]"

Michael Dawson,michael_dawson@ca.ibm.com,2020-09-04T20:00:06Z,"build: introduce include_dir

Introduce `include_dir` for use with gyp in a scalar context

Deprecate use of `include` in an gyp array context, which
happens to work when paths are absolute, but can fail on Windows
when paths are relative and a gyp file contains multiple entries
in its `include_dirs` directive.

This change corrects documentation and tooling, adds support for
relative paths (e.g. those containing whitespace) in a backwards
compatible manner and makes the approach holistically consistent
with that used by nan.

Gabriel Schulhof,gabriel.schulhof@intel.com,2020-08-25T02:56:25Z,"src: concentrate callbacks provided to core N-API

This change reduces the places where we declare private functions with
the `napi_callback` signature for the purpose of using them with C++
callbacks passed as template arguments. We basically have 4 types:

  1. static with `void` return
  2. static with `napi_value` return
  3. instance with `void` return
  4. instance with `napi_value` return

We can use one of these four calling patterns in the following places
where we accept callbacks as template arguments:
  * `Napi::Function` (1. and 2.)
  * `Napi::PropertyDescriptor` (1. for the setter, 2. for the getter)
  * `Napi::InstanceWrap<T>` (3., 4. for instance methods, 4. for
     instance getters)
  * `Napi::ObjectWrap<T>` (1., 2. for static methods, 2. for static
     getters)

In the case of `InstanceWrap<T>` and `ObjectWrap<T>` instance resp.
static property descriptors we can also remove the infrastructure
designed to allow for optional getters (`GetterTag` resp.
`StaticGetterTag`) because the API for specifying instance resp. class
property descriptors does not allow one to omit the getter.

Gabriel Schulhof,gabriel.schulhof@intel.com,2020-07-22T20:20:58Z,"src: add Addon<T> class

* separate out instance-related APIs from `ObjectWrap<T>` into a new
  class `InstanceWrap<T>` which then becomes a base class for
  `ObjectWrap<T>`.
* Add `Addon<T>` class as a subclass of `InstanceWrap<T>`,
  reimplementing `Unwrap()` to retrieve the instance data using
  `GetInstanceData<T>()` of `Napi::Env` instead of `napi_unwrap()`.
* Add macros `NODE_API_ADDON()` and `NODE_API_NAMED_ADDON()` to load an
  add-on from its `Addon<T>` subclass definition.

Bindings created like this perform slightly worse than static ones in
exchange for the benefit of having the context of a class instance as
their C++ `this` object. This way, they avoid having to call
`info.GetInstanceData<ClassName>()` in the bindings, which brings with
it the risk that the wrong `ClassName` will end up in the template
parameter thus resulting in a hard-to-track-down segfault. Static
bindings can still be created and associated with the `exports` object
and they can use `Napi::Env::GetInstanceData()` to retrieve the add-on
instance.

Gabriel Schulhof,gabriel.schulhof@intel.com,2020-02-08T04:24:31Z,"objectwrap: remove wrap only on failure

`napi_remove_wrap()` was intended for objects that are alive for which
the native addon wishes to withdraw its native pointer, and perhaps
replace it with another.

Therefore we need not `napi_remove_wrap()` during gc/env-cleanup. It is
sufficient to `napi_delete_reference()`, as `Reference<Object>`
already does. We need only `napi_remove_wrap()` if the construction
failed and therefore no gc callback will ever happen.

This change also removes references to `ObjectWrapConstructionContext`
from the header because the class is not used anymore.

Gabriel Schulhof,gabriel.schulhof@intel.com,2020-01-17T18:14:55Z,"src: call `napi_remove_wrap()` in `ObjectWrap` dtor

Currently, when the `ObjectWrap` constructor runs, it calls
`napi_wrap()`, adding a finalize callback to the freshly created
JS object.

However, if the `ObjectWrap` instance is prematurely deleted,
for example because a subclass constructor throws – which seems
like a reasonable scenario – that finalize callback was not removed,
possibly leading to a use-after-free crash.

This commit adds a call `napi_remove_wrap()` from the `ObjectWrap`
destructor,  and a test for that scenario.

This also changes the code to use the correct pointer type
in `FinalizeCallback`, which may not match the incorretct one
in cases of multiple inheritance.

Two different cases must be taken into consideration:

1. The exception in the constructor was caused by

2. The exception in the constructor was caused by the constructor of

Gabriel Schulhof,gabriel.schulhof@intel.com,2019-12-05T20:27:41Z,"objectwrap: add template methods

ObjectWrap<T> was enhanced to support template methods for
defining properties and methods of JS class. Now C++ methods and
functions may be passed as template parameters for
ObjectWrap<T>::InstanceMethod, ObjectWrap<T>::StaticAccessor, etc.

There are several benefits:

  - no need to allocate extra memory for passing C++ function
    napi callback and use add_finalizer() to free memory;
  - a compiler can see whole chain of calls up to napi callback
    that may allow better optimisation.

Some examples:

```cpp
// Method
InstanceMethod<&MyClass::method>(""method"");

// Read-write property
InstanceAccessor<&MyClass::get, &MyClass::set>(""rw_prop"");

// Read-only property
InstanceAccessor<&MyClass::get>(""ro_prop"");
```

Add static methods to `PropertyDescriptor` that allows the definition
of accessors where the getter/setter is specified as a template
parameter rather than a function parameter. This allows us to avoid
heap-allocating callback data.

`AsyncWorker` contained the assumption that instances of its subclasses
were allocated using `new`, because it unconditionally destroyed
instances using `delete`.

This change replaces the call to `delete` with a call to a protected
instance method `Destroy()`, which can be overridden by subclasses.
This ensures that users can employ their own allocators when
creating `AsyncWorker` subclass instances because they can override
the `Destroy()` method to use their deallocator of choice.

Macros `NAPI_THROW`, `NAPI_THROW_IF_FAILED`, and `NAPI_FATAL_IF_FAILED`
have so far been used only in the implementation of node-addon-api.
Nevertheless, they are useful in cases where direct N-API calls must be
interspersed between normal node-addon-api usage. The greatest value
they provide is that they convert non-`napi_ok` `napi_status` values
into errors that can be thrown, and that they throw the errors
respecting whether C++ exceptions are enabled or not.

Adds tools/check-napi.js which uses `nm -a` on UNIX and
`dumpbin /imports` on Windows to check whether a given `.node` file
is an N-API module or not. Intentionally ignores files named
`nothing.node` because they are node-addon-api build artefacts.

Sets the target type for `nothing` (which gets built when a built-in
N-API is found to be present) to `'static_library'` so as to avoid the
creation of `nothing.node` files which incorrectly end up showing up in
the output of `check-napi.js` as non-N-API modules.

In the current implementation, this check was omitted. So, the following
code will cause a crash.
  ```

In the current implementation, if we want to make a readonly property,
we should pass empty setter that is actual function but has no body
as follows:
  void HelloSetter(const Npai::CallbackInfo& info,
                   const Npai::Value& value) {
    // This is an empty setter to make a readonly property.
    // Do nothing
  }

  InstanceAccessor(""hello_property"", &HelloGetter, &HelloSetter);

If we allows taking `nullptr` as the argument, we can simplify user's
code more as follows:
  InstanceAccessor(""hello_property"", &HelloGetter, nullptr);

Currently, above code makes a crash. So, this patch makes
InstanceAccessor() take `nullptr` as the argument and then add some
tests for them.

Anna Henningsen,anna@addaleax.net,2017-10-12T06:18:47Z,"Refactor property setting

Previously, various utility overloads of `Object::Set()` were provided.
This was problematic, because accidental unexpected conversions
could happen (e.g. `const char*` to `bool`) and overloads were
ambiguous (e.g. `int` could be cast to `double` and `bool` and therefore
could not be passed directly).

To address this, pass a template parameter instead, and introduce
a helper `Value::From` method that could create a value based on the
type of object it receives, and that uses clear precedence rules for
determining the kind of JS value to create.
