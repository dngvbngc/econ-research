GitHub,noreply@github.com,2024-01-17T22:42:52Z,"Stabilize custom cache handlers and changing memory size. (#57953)

This PR stabilizes the previously introduced experimental config options
for providing a custom cache handler (for both ISR as well as the Data
Cache) and for disabling or configuring the in-memory cache size. The
example usage would be as follows:

```js
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  cacheHandler: require.resolve('./cache-handler.js'),
  cacheMaxMemorySize: 0 // disable default in-memory caching
}
```

This PR also updates the documentation to better reflect how to use the
custom cache handler when self-hosting. Further information will be
added in a following PR that also includes a full example of a custom
cache handler that implements `revalidateTag` as well as passing in
custom cache tags. The API reference docs have been updated here, as
well as a version history added.

I also noticed that we currently have two duplicated versions of the ISR
docs in the Pages Router docs: both for rendering and for data fetching.
Data Fetching is the correct location for this page. There were no other
references to the rendering version in the docs, so that must have been
an accident. I'll need to a get a redirect going for that regardless.

Tests have been updated for `cacheHandler` and I added a new test for
`cacheMaxMemorySize`.

This PR stabilizes the previously introduced experimental config options
for providing a custom cache handler (for both ISR as well as the Data
Cache) and for disabling or configuring the in-memory cache size. The
example usage would be as follows:

```js
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  cacheHandler: require.resolve('./cache-handler.js'),
  cacheMaxMemorySize: 0 // disable default in-memory caching
}
```

This PR also updates the documentation to better reflect how to use the
custom cache handler when self-hosting. Further information will be
added in a following PR that also includes a full example of a custom
cache handler that implements `revalidateTag` as well as passing in
custom cache tags. The API reference docs have been updated here, as
well as a version history added.

I also noticed that we currently have two duplicated versions of the ISR
docs in the Pages Router docs: both for rendering and for data fetching.
Data Fetching is the correct location for this page. There were no other
references to the rendering version in the docs, so that must have been
an accident. I'll need to a get a redirect going for that regardless.

Tests have been updated for `cacheHandler` and I added a new test for
`cacheMaxMemorySize`.

Skip postcss config resolving in node_modules for Turbopack. This
matches current Next.js on webpack closer as that only resolves the

As Barrel Optimization might split one file into multiple different

might be transformed differently, we can no longer rely on the file path

This fix adds a suffix (`'@' + this._module.matchResource`) to the

- Both the standalone server and the `startServer` function it calls
attempt to stop the server on `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` in different ways.
This lets `server.js` yield to `startServer`
- The cleanup function in `startServer` was not waiting for the server
to close before calling `process.exit`. This lets it wait for any
in-flight requests to finish processing before exiting the process
- Sends `SIGKILL` to the child process in `next dev`, which should have
the same effect of immediately shutting down the server on `SIGTERM` or
`SIGINT`

fixes: #53661
refs: #59551

------

Previously #59551 attempted to fix #53661, but had broken some tests in
the process. It looks like the final commit was also missing an intended
change to `utils.ts`. This should fix those issues as well as introduce
a new set of tests for the graceful shutdown feature.

In the last PR I was squashing and force-pushing updates along the way
but it made it difficult to track the changes. This time I'm pushing
quite a few commits to make it easier to track the changes and refactors
I've made, with the idea that this should be squashed before being
merged.

- Both the standalone server and the `startServer` function it calls
attempt to stop the server on `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` in different ways.
This lets `server.js` yield to `startServer`
- The cleanup function in `startServer` was not waiting for the server
to close before calling `process.exit`. This lets it wait for any
in-flight requests to finish processing before exiting the process
- Sends `SIGKILL` to the child process in `next dev`, which should have

------

Previously #59551 attempted to fix #53661, but had broken some tests in
the process. It looks like the final commit was also missing an intended
change to `utils.ts`. This should fix those issues as well as introduce
a new set of tests for the graceful shutdown feature.

In the last PR I was squashing and force-pushing updates along the way
but it made it difficult to track the changes. This time I'm pushing
quite a few commits to make it easier to track the changes and refactors
I've made, with the idea that this should be squashed before being
merged.

### What

Sometimes the display of the error overlay is not consistent even when
you fixed the error

Example:
* You have a client page, and you add metadata export, Next.js will
error that it's not allowed in client component.
* You fix it, but the error overlay is not disappeared. Or you fix it,
then introduce it again, then fix it again, the error overlay is still
there.

### How

We're checking if the HMR webpack hash is changed to decide if we're
going to do a hot update in `BUILT` and `SYNC` event, but we update the
hash at the very beginning of the event handler. `isUpdateAvailable()`
will return `false` in the later calls but the hash has already changed
before. So we check if they change before applying hot updates, and then
use it later with `isUpdateAvailable()` to determine if necessary to
process a new hot update

## What?

Removes `normalizeSnapshot` helper in the test suite as it only replaces
based on `NEXT_SWC_DEV_BIN` but that env var is no longer provided
anywhere. This ensures that Jest can update the inline snapshots.

Removes `normalizeSnapshot` helper in the test suite as it only replaces
based on `NEXT_SWC_DEV_BIN` but that env var is no longer provided
anywhere. This ensures that Jest can update the inline snapshots.

## What?

Updates snapshots for Turbopack tests. They're slightly different than
the webpack output. Generally better because column information is
preserved. The import trace is not available in Turbopack as it would
make the parent module a direct dependency of the module, meaning it
would have to recompile every time you can the parent module. We'll
figure out if it can be added in a different way at a later point.

## What?

Updates snapshots for Turbopack tests. They're slightly different than
the webpack output. Generally better because column information is
preserved. The import trace is not available in Turbopack as it would
make the parent module a direct dependency of the module, meaning it
would have to recompile every time you can the parent module. We'll
figure out if it can be added in a different way at a later point.

## What?

As @leerob and I found in-person when opening #57230 the `hasRedBox()`
helper was incorrectly passing when it shouldn't pass in both the true
and false case.

This PR uses a different approach by waiting 7 seconds before checking,
this leaves enough room for HMR / reloads to apply, it doesn't
meaningfully slow down the test suite and increases reliability of the
check as you can see below in the tests that were previously passing
that are no longer passing.

I've moved these to skipped tests for landing this PR as I want to avoid
further issues being introduced while we fix them. @huozhi will

GitHub,noreply@github.com,2024-01-15T08:36:44Z,"Add hasRedbox fix (#60522)

## What?

As @leerob and I found in-person when opening #57230 the `hasRedBox()`
helper was incorrectly passing when it shouldn't pass in both the true
and false case.

This PR uses a different approach by waiting 7 seconds before checking,
this leaves enough room for HMR / reloads to apply, it doesn't
meaningfully slow down the test suite and increases reliability of the
check as you can see below in the tests that were previously passing
that are no longer passing.

I've moved these to skipped tests for landing this PR as I want to avoid
further issues being introduced while we fix them. @huozhi will
investigate these next week 👍

## What?

As @leerob and I found in-person when opening #57230 the `hasRedBox()`
helper was incorrectly passing when it shouldn't pass in both the true
and false case.

This PR uses a different approach by waiting 7 seconds before checking,
this leaves enough room for HMR / reloads to apply, it doesn't
meaningfully slow down the test suite and increases reliability of the
check as you can see below in the tests that were previously passing
that are no longer passing.

I've moved these to skipped tests for landing this PR as I want to avoid
further issues being introduced while we fix them. @huozhi will
investigate these next week 👍

GitHub,noreply@github.com,2024-01-15T08:36:44Z,"Add hasRedbox fix (#60522)

## What?

As @leerob and I found in-person when opening #57230 the `hasRedBox()`
helper was incorrectly passing when it shouldn't pass in both the true
and false case.

This PR uses a different approach by waiting 7 seconds before checking,
this leaves enough room for HMR / reloads to apply, it doesn't
meaningfully slow down the test suite and increases reliability of the
check as you can see below in the tests that were previously passing
that are no longer passing.

I've moved these to skipped tests for landing this PR as I want to avoid
further issues being introduced while we fix them. @huozhi will
investigate these next week 👍

GitHub,noreply@github.com,2024-01-15T08:36:44Z,"Add hasRedbox fix (#60522)

## What?

As @leerob and I found in-person when opening #57230 the `hasRedBox()`
helper was incorrectly passing when it shouldn't pass in both the true
and false case.

This PR uses a different approach by waiting 7 seconds before checking,
this leaves enough room for HMR / reloads to apply, it doesn't
meaningfully slow down the test suite and increases reliability of the
check as you can see below in the tests that were previously passing
that are no longer passing.

I've moved these to skipped tests for landing this PR as I want to avoid
further issues being introduced while we fix them. @huozhi will
investigate these next week 👍

GitHub,noreply@github.com,2024-01-15T08:36:44Z,"Add hasRedbox fix (#60522)

## What?

As @leerob and I found in-person when opening #57230 the `hasRedBox()`
helper was incorrectly passing when it shouldn't pass in both the true
and false case.

This PR uses a different approach by waiting 7 seconds before checking,
this leaves enough room for HMR / reloads to apply, it doesn't
meaningfully slow down the test suite and increases reliability of the
check as you can see below in the tests that were previously passing
that are no longer passing.

I've moved these to skipped tests for landing this PR as I want to avoid
further issues being introduced while we fix them. @huozhi will

GitHub,noreply@github.com,2024-01-15T08:36:44Z,"Add hasRedbox fix (#60522)

## What?

As @leerob and I found in-person when opening #57230 the `hasRedBox()`
helper was incorrectly passing when it shouldn't pass in both the true
and false case.

This PR uses a different approach by waiting 7 seconds before checking,
this leaves enough room for HMR / reloads to apply, it doesn't
meaningfully slow down the test suite and increases reliability of the
check as you can see below in the tests that were previously passing
that are no longer passing.

I've moved these to skipped tests for landing this PR as I want to avoid
further issues being introduced while we fix them. @huozhi will
investigate these next week 👍

GitHub,noreply@github.com,2024-01-15T08:36:44Z,"Add hasRedbox fix (#60522)

## What?

As @leerob and I found in-person when opening #57230 the `hasRedBox()`
helper was incorrectly passing when it shouldn't pass in both the true
and false case.

This PR uses a different approach by waiting 7 seconds before checking,
this leaves enough room for HMR / reloads to apply, it doesn't
meaningfully slow down the test suite and increases reliability of the
check as you can see below in the tests that were previously passing
that are no longer passing.

I've moved these to skipped tests for landing this PR as I want to avoid
further issues being introduced while we fix them. @huozhi will
investigate these next week 👍

GitHub,noreply@github.com,2024-01-15T08:36:44Z,"Add hasRedbox fix (#60522)

## What?

As @leerob and I found in-person when opening #57230 the `hasRedBox()`
helper was incorrectly passing when it shouldn't pass in both the true
and false case.

This PR uses a different approach by waiting 7 seconds before checking,
this leaves enough room for HMR / reloads to apply, it doesn't
meaningfully slow down the test suite and increases reliability of the
check as you can see below in the tests that were previously passing
that are no longer passing.

I've moved these to skipped tests for landing this PR as I want to avoid
further issues being introduced while we fix them. @huozhi will
investigate these next week 👍

GitHub,noreply@github.com,2024-01-15T08:36:44Z,"Add hasRedbox fix (#60522)

## What?

As @leerob and I found in-person when opening #57230 the `hasRedBox()`
helper was incorrectly passing when it shouldn't pass in both the true
and false case.

This PR uses a different approach by waiting 7 seconds before checking,
this leaves enough room for HMR / reloads to apply, it doesn't
meaningfully slow down the test suite and increases reliability of the
check as you can see below in the tests that were previously passing
that are no longer passing.

I've moved these to skipped tests for landing this PR as I want to avoid
further issues being introduced while we fix them. @huozhi will
investigate these next week 👍

GitHub,noreply@github.com,2024-01-15T08:36:44Z,"Add hasRedbox fix (#60522)

## What?

As @leerob and I found in-person when opening #57230 the `hasRedBox()`
helper was incorrectly passing when it shouldn't pass in both the true
and false case.

This PR uses a different approach by waiting 7 seconds before checking,
this leaves enough room for HMR / reloads to apply, it doesn't
meaningfully slow down the test suite and increases reliability of the
check as you can see below in the tests that were previously passing
that are no longer passing.

I've moved these to skipped tests for landing this PR as I want to avoid
further issues being introduced while we fix them. @huozhi will
investigate these next week 👍

GitHub,noreply@github.com,2024-01-15T08:36:44Z,"Add hasRedbox fix (#60522)

## What?

As @leerob and I found in-person when opening #57230 the `hasRedBox()`
helper was incorrectly passing when it shouldn't pass in both the true
and false case.

This PR uses a different approach by waiting 7 seconds before checking,
this leaves enough room for HMR / reloads to apply, it doesn't
meaningfully slow down the test suite and increases reliability of the
check as you can see below in the tests that were previously passing
that are no longer passing.

I've moved these to skipped tests for landing this PR as I want to avoid
further issues being introduced while we fix them. @huozhi will
investigate these next week 👍

## What?

As @leerob and I found in-person when opening #57230 the `hasRedBox()`
helper was incorrectly passing when it shouldn't pass in both the true
and false case.

This PR uses a different approach by waiting 7 seconds before checking,
this leaves enough room for HMR / reloads to apply, it doesn't
meaningfully slow down the test suite and increases reliability of the
check as you can see below in the tests that were previously passing
that are no longer passing.

GitHub,noreply@github.com,2024-01-15T08:36:44Z,"Add hasRedbox fix (#60522)

## What?

As @leerob and I found in-person when opening #57230 the `hasRedBox()`
helper was incorrectly passing when it shouldn't pass in both the true
and false case.

This PR uses a different approach by waiting 7 seconds before checking,
this leaves enough room for HMR / reloads to apply, it doesn't
meaningfully slow down the test suite and increases reliability of the
check as you can see below in the tests that were previously passing
that are no longer passing.

I've moved these to skipped tests for landing this PR as I want to avoid
further issues being introduced while we fix them. @huozhi will
investigate these next week 👍

### Depends on

---

A popstate navigation reads data from the local cache. It does not issue
new network requests (unless the cache entries have been evicted). So,
when navigating with back/forward, we should not switch back to the PPR
loading state. We should render the full, cached dynamic data
immediately.

To implement this, on a popstate navigation, we update the cache to drop
the prefetch data for any segment whose dynamic data was already
received. We clone the entire cache node tree and set the `prefetchRsc`
field to `null` to prevent it from being rendered. (We can't mutate the
node in place because Cache Node is a concurrent data structure.)

Technically, what we're actually checking is whether the dynamic network
response was received. But since it's a streaming response, this does
not mean that all the dynamic data has fully streamed in. It just means
that _some_ of the dynamic data was received. But as a heuristic, we
assume that the rest dynamic data will stream in quickly, so it's still
better to skip the prefetch state.

A popstate navigation reads data from the local cache. It does not issue
new network requests (unless the cache entries have been evicted). So,
when navigating with back/forward, we should not switch back to the PPR
loading state. We should render the full, cached dynamic data
immediately.

To implement this, on a popstate navigation, we update the cache to drop
the prefetch data for any segment whose dynamic data was already
received. We clone the entire cache node tree and set the `prefetchRsc`
field to `null` to prevent it from being rendered. (We can't mutate the
node in place because Cache Node is a concurrent data structure.)

Technically, what we're actually checking is whether the dynamic network
response was received. But since it's a streaming response, this does
not mean that all the dynamic data has fully streamed in. It just means
that _some_ of the dynamic data was received. But as a heuristic, we
assume that the rest dynamic data will stream in quickly, so it's still
better to skip the prefetch state.

### What?
Throwing a `notFound()` error inside of a segment that has an error
boundary will cause it to be handled by the segment's error boundary

### Why?
We assume anything that hits an `ErrorBoundary` is an actual error, but

This updates our default error rate to be much more precise and reduce
false positives by increasing the default size of the client filter we
generate. We can afford to increase the default size as it compresses
extremely well and gives us more accurate navigations. This carries over
the failing test case from https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/59293
which showed one case of false positive in a smaller filter.

GitHub,noreply@github.com,2024-01-11T10:12:22Z,"Ensure aliased variable is used in test (#60428)

## What?

This test fails in Turbopack currently as Turbopack handles unused
imports smarter than webpack. This change makes sure the variable is
used so the import is not shaken out.

GitHub,noreply@github.com,2024-01-11T10:08:29Z,"fix: redirect logic missing basePath in App Render (#60184)

### What?

Fixes #58570 

### How?

Include the **basePath** to the **fetchUrl** to ensure the relative URL
matches the app when deployed under a **basePath**.

### Tested?

I have added an **e2e** test with a basic custom server & server action
redirect.

This test was confirmed to **catch** the bug when running it without the
fix in place. When running it you will get the failed result.

### Notes

Not sure if there are any edge cases where the `fetchUrl` is now broken
in other use cases where there is no **basePath**, I assume the string
would be empty `""""` and result in the same URL as before, but not sure?

### Disclosure

~I am not that familiar with the Next.js code base and this is my first
PR. I was struggling to find out how to grab the **basePath** from
`next.config.js`, but then noticed the **assetPrefix** inside the
function matched, so decided to use that for minimal change. I don't
know if there are any caveats with this approach, but could consider
switching to pull directly from the config file, if that's possible?~

**Update:** Figured out where the **basePath** came from and switched
it.

This PR introduces 2 experimental options for doing more work in the
webpack build in parallel instead of in serial. These options may
improve the performance of builds at the cost of more memory.

`parallelServerAndEdgeCompiles`: This option kicks off the builds for
both `server` and `edge-server` at the same time instead of waiting for
each to complete before the next one. In applications that have many
server and edge functions, this can increase performance by doing that
work in parallel. This can be used with `next build` or `next
experimental-compile`.

`parallelServerBuildTraces`: This option starts the server build traces
as soon as the server compile completes and runs it in the background
while the other compilations are happening. With this option enabled,
some unnecessary work may be done since ordinarily the client
compilation provides information that can reduce the amount of tracing
necessary. However, since it is in parallel with the other work, it may
still result in a faster build in total at the cost of more memory. This
option is already the default when using `next experimental-compile` but
can now be used when `next build` is used also.

some unnecessary work may be done since ordinarily the client

GitHub,noreply@github.com,2024-01-10T22:14:19Z,"parallel routes: fix client reference manifest grouping for catch-all segments (#60482)

### What?
When using catch-all routes in conjunction with parallel routes, and
when importing a client component (`""use client""`), the build would fail
with the following error:

> Could not find the module ""PathToClientComponent"" in the React Client
Manifest. This is probably a bug in the React Server Components bundler.

### Why?
`flight-manifest-plugin` generates manifests for each page entry. The
`clientModules` portion of this manifest is used by React to load the
appropriate client module. When React attempts to render a component
tree and detects a module that it cannot find, it will throw this error.
To illustrate why it isn't in the tree, consider the following example:

```
app
  page.tsx
  layout.tsx
  @slot
    [...catchAll]
      page.tsx
```

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
export default function Layout({children, slot}) {
  return <>{children} {slot}</>
}
```
```tsx
// app/@slot/[...catchAll]/page.tsx
import Link from 'next/link'
export default function Page() {
  return <Link href=""/"">Test</Link>
}
```

When visiting `/`, we'd expect both the catch-all `@slot` and the root
page to render. At build time, we'll generate a client reference
manifest for `/` and `/[...catchAll]` since both are page components.
However, the `@slot` imports a client component. When we attempt to load
the client reference manifest for `/`, it will ignore the catch-all
slot's manifest, resulting in the error.

### How?
The `entryNameToGroupName` function seems to already exist to handle
this scenario for other cases. For example,
`app/(group)/@named/foo/page` needs to know about any manifests
associated with `app/foo`. This updates the code to apply similar
handling to catchAll segments. When applying this change to the example
mentioned earlier, it will properly merge the manifests for both
`app/@slot/[...catchAll]/page.tsx` and `app/page.tsx` because both will
be part of the `/` group.

`app/(group)/@named/foo/page` needs to know about any manifests
associated with `app/foo`. This updates the code to apply similar
handling to catchAll segments. When applying this change to the example
mentioned earlier, it will properly merge the manifests for both
`app/@slot/[...catchAll]/page.tsx` and `app/page.tsx` because both will
be part of the `/` group.

GitHub,noreply@github.com,2024-01-10T22:14:19Z,"parallel routes: fix client reference manifest grouping for catch-all segments (#60482)

### What?
When using catch-all routes in conjunction with parallel routes, and
when importing a client component (`""use client""`), the build would fail
with the following error:

> Could not find the module ""PathToClientComponent"" in the React Client
Manifest. This is probably a bug in the React Server Components bundler.

### Why?
`flight-manifest-plugin` generates manifests for each page entry. The
`clientModules` portion of this manifest is used by React to load the
appropriate client module. When React attempts to render a component
tree and detects a module that it cannot find, it will throw this error.
To illustrate why it isn't in the tree, consider the following example:

```
app
  page.tsx
  layout.tsx
  @slot
    [...catchAll]
      page.tsx
```

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
export default function Layout({children, slot}) {
  return <>{children} {slot}</>
}
```
```tsx
// app/@slot/[...catchAll]/page.tsx
import Link from 'next/link'
export default function Page() {
  return <Link href=""/"">Test</Link>
}
```

When visiting `/`, we'd expect both the catch-all `@slot` and the root
page to render. At build time, we'll generate a client reference
manifest for `/` and `/[...catchAll]` since both are page components.
However, the `@slot` imports a client component. When we attempt to load
the client reference manifest for `/`, it will ignore the catch-all
slot's manifest, resulting in the error.

### How?
The `entryNameToGroupName` function seems to already exist to handle
this scenario for other cases. For example,
`app/(group)/@named/foo/page` needs to know about any manifests
associated with `app/foo`. This updates the code to apply similar
handling to catchAll segments. When applying this change to the example
mentioned earlier, it will properly merge the manifests for both
`app/@slot/[...catchAll]/page.tsx` and `app/page.tsx` because both will
be part of the `/` group.
