1492,vmoroz,"Fix PR fixes compilation errors and warnings while compiling code in VS 2022.
- async_worker.cc used deprecated `std::allocator` APIs. Their use is is replaced with APIs that is still valid.
- There was a strange error in `ObjectWrap<T>::WrappedMethod`. It was saying that `&` operation requires an l-value. The issue is fixed by copying `method` pointer to a local variable before invocation.
- VS identified that some fields were not initialized. They are changed to initialize with `{}`.
- VS identified that some functions must be `noexcept`. They are augmented with `NAPI_NOEXCEPT`.

1479,lovell,"This PR contains a proposal to expose the package `version` property in the public API.

The `version` value is already used by the conversion tooling and is additionally useful in external contexts too, for example when specifying/detecting `node-addon-api` as an optional and/or peer dependency.

This would bring `node-addon-api` in line with `node-gyp`, which already exports `require('node-gyp').version`. The change in the PR will allow me to improve the install-time detecting/logging for `node-addon-api` within `sharp`.

It also adds a test with expectations for this property as well as all existing exported properties.

1409,gabrielschulhof,"Since we made the default for Node.js core finalizers synchronous for users running with `NAPI_EXPERIMENTAL` and introduced `env->CheckGCAccess()` in Node.js core, we must now defer all finalizers in node-addon-api, because our users likely make non-gc-safe Node-API calls from existing finalizers. To that end,

  * Use the NAPI_VERSION environment variable to detect whether `NAPI_EXPERIMENTAL` should be on, and add it to the defines if `NAPI_VERSION` is set to `NAPI_VERSION_EXPERIMENTAL`, i.e. 2147483647.
  * When building with `NAPI_EXPERIMENTAL`,
    * render all finalizers asynchronous, and
    * expect `napi_cannot_run_js` instead of `napi_exception_pending`.
